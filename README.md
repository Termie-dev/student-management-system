# student-manager
 Learning Springboot using a university student manager

# What I learned from Spring Boot by creating this project
## StudentController.java - API Layer (Handles API Requests)

### @RestController
Definition: Tells Spring Boot this class will handle HTTP requests
- It is a "web controller"
- Different controller classes correspond to different URL paths

### @RequestMapping(path="api/v1/student")
Definition: Tells Spring Boot that all methods in this class will use /api/v1/student as a base URL
Why?: So you don't re-write full URL in every method

### @Autowired
Definition: Installs dependencies automatically
Dependency: Something that another part of the code needs to function.
Dependency injection: Technique where Spring automatically provides the needed dependencies (like StudentService) instead of you manually creating them.

~Normally~: StudentService studentService = new StudentService();
- Bad practice: Makes code hard to test and hard to change

Instead: @Autowired tells Spring Boot find an existing StudentService and provide it here.

### @GetMapping(subpath)
Definition: Tells Spring Boot that when someone sends a GET request to api/v1/students, this method should be called.
Could have multiple in a class as long as they have different subpaths

## StudentService.java - Service Layer (Handles business logic and manages student data. Does not touch web requests.)

### @Service
Definition: Tells Spring Boot this class contains business logic (processing and handling data)
Why? Service class is where we put logic related to data processing, keeping Controller clean. This class could fetch data from a database or calculate a student's grade

## Student.java - Data/PostgreSQL Layer (This class is a Java representation of a database table)

### @Entity
Definition: Tells Spring Boot to mark the class as a Database Table. Allos Spring Boot to save and retrieve student data from a database.

### @Table
Definition: Defines name of database table, If empty, it names table "student" by default.

### @Id
Definition: Marks "id" as the primary key, which uniquely identifies each student. Tells Spring Boot where to assign the values from sequence generator.

### @SequenceGenerator
Definition: Tells database use a sequence (counter that generates unique IDs)

### @GeneratedValue
Definition: Automatically assigns unique ID when new student is added

### Database working in practice
When you run app, Spring Boot creates this table:

    CREATE TABLE student (
        id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS SEQUENCE student_sequence,
        name VARCHAR(255),
        email VARCHAR(255),
        dob DATE,
        age INTEGER
    );

When you write this code:

    Student student = new Student();
    student.setName("John Doe");
    student.setEmail("johndoe@gmail.com");
    student.setDob(LocalDate.of(2001, Month.JANUARY, 15));
    student.setAge(23);

    studentRepository.save(student);

Spring Boot executes:

    INSERT INTO student (name, email, dob, age) VALUES ('John Doe', 'johndoe@gmail.com', '2001-01-15', 23);

And the database automatically generates the id

## StudentRepository.java - Data Access Layer to Interact with Database
Definition: Helps retrieve, save, update and delete students without writing SQL
- Repository: Special class that interacts with database.

### @Repository
Tells Spring Boot "This class should communicate with the database"

### JpaRepository<Student, Long>
Allows repository to work with Student entity

## StudentConfig.java
Definition: Preloads data into database when application starts.

### @Configuration
Marks class as configuration file.
Tells Spring Boot "This class sets up some behavior when the app starts"

### @Bean
Definition: Special method that runs code on startup. Lets us insert sample data into database.

### CommandLineRunner
Function that runs when the application starts.

## Everything Put Together

1. User requests student data, sends GET request
2. Spring Boot routes the request, @GetMapping in StudentController calls getStudents() in StudentService
3. getStudents() returns list of students
4. Spring Boot coverts Student objects into JSON format that can be sent to web browser or another application
